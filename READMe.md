#### Cool, Can I install/Use this too ?
Well, this is an independent CMS, unlike WordPress, this is NOT FOR PERSONAL USE. We are looking forward to extend this project into a full WordPress like CMS, however that is completely depended on funding and contribution from the open source world.It will take time.
